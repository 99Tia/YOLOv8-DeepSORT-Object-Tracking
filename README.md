# Vehicle detection, tracking, and counting using YOLOv8 and DeepSORT algorithm.

This project utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to detect, track, and count vehicles in real-time from video streams. By combining the powerful YOLOv8 object detection algorithm with the DeepSORT tracking algorithm, we achieve robust and accurate vehicle monitoring. This technology can be applied in various domains, such as traffic management, surveillance, and urban planning. 

Adaptive Traffic Signals: Use real-time vehicle counts and flow data to optimize traffic light timings, reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.

Traffic Data Collection: Collect accurate data on vehicle volumes, types, and speeds to inform infrastructure planning and development projects.

Surveillance: Monitor vehicles in sensitive or restricted areas for security purposes, identifying suspicious activities or unauthorized access.

Real-Time Parking Availability: Track vehicles entering and exiting parking facilities to provide real-time updates on available parking spots.

Fleet Management: Track and monitor delivery vehicles in real-time to optimize routes, improve delivery times, and ensure the security of goods.
